## Technical Architecture

<!-- TODO: Create a high-level architecture diagram (e.g., using draw.io or similar tool) and save it as `docs/architecture.png`.
     Describe the architecture briefly below.
     Example:
     Uniconnect is built using a client-server architecture. The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) that communicates with a RESTful API backend.
-->

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png) <!-- Placeholder for your diagram -->

The application follows a standard three-tier architecture:
1.  **Client (Frontend):** Handles user interface and interaction.
2.  **Server (Backend):** Manages business logic, API endpoints, and data processing.
3.  **Database:** Stores and retrieves application data.

## Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern and robust technology stack:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   React.js
    *   Tailwind CSS
    *   HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   (Likely: Axios for HTTP requests, React Router for navigation)
*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js
    *   Express.js (for RESTful APIs)
    *   Mongoose/MongoDB for database interaction)
    *   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
*   **Database:**
    *   MongoDB atlas
*   **Development & Tools:**
    *   Git & GitHub
    *   VS Code
    *   npm or yarn for package management
